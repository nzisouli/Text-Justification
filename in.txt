There 	is     a lovely road   that runs from 	Ixopo into the hills. 
These 	hills are grass-covered    and rolling, and they are lovely beyond any 

singing of it. The road climbs seven miles 

into them, to Carisbrooke; and from there, if there is no mist, you look 
down 	on 	one				of the fairest valleys of Africa.
